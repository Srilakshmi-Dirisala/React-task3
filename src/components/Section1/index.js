                    </h1>
                    <p>Over the past two years, there has been an explosion of listings on trading platforms such as
                        Binance, Bitmex, Bittrex, etc. Over the same period, trading volume skyrocketed by 1,06,435.67
                        percent to $79.22 trillion. This rise has naturally doubled the number of accounts on different
                        exchanges with a corresponding increase in subscription demand from trading signal sales
                        companies.</p>
                    <h1>Project Engagement</h1>
                    <p>During the 11th of March 2022, WinWinCoins Team engaged Solidproof.io to audit smart contracts
                        that they created. The engagement was technical in nature and focused on identifying security
                        flaws in the design and implementation of the contracts. They provided Solidproof.io with access
                        to their code repository and whitepaper.</p><br />
